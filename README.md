# Loan-Prediction

Objective: To predict loan status i.e. whether to give loan or not based on given variables.

Data: Data is used from Analytics Vidhya Loan Prediction III - Practice Hackathon. For detail description of data visit https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/

Methodology: The data is partition into training and validation datasets. The project uses replacement of missing value and creating new variables as Total Income, EMI and Balance Amout as part of Feature Engineering. To predict the loan status, I applied various machine learning algorithms used are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest and S.V.M. Models were developed based on training dataset excluding some observations which were kept for validation purpose, and then applied on the test dataset to get the output.

Conclusion:
