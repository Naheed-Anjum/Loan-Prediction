# Loan-Prediction

**Objective**: To predict loan status i.e. whether to give loan or not based on given variables.

**Data**: Data is used from Analytics Vidhya Loan Prediction III - Practice Hackathon. For detail description of data visit https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/

**Methodology**: The train dataset was split into training and validation sets. Missing values were replaced, and new variables such as Total Income, EMI, and Balance Amount were created as part of feature engineering. Various machine learning algorithms—Binary Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were applied. Models were trained on the training dataset, validated on the validation dataset, and finally tested on unseen data to generate predictions.

Also, involved creating various graphical visualizations of loan status data along with other variables, supporting data-driven decision-making and insights.

**Conclusion**:
